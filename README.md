## Project Overview

The main goal of this project is to analyze ball-by-ball data from IPL matches. The analysis includes various statistics, trends, and insights derived from the data. The results are presented through an interactive webpage created using Streamlit, with additional visualizations provided by Power BI dashboards.

## Data Collection
